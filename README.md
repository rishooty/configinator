# configinator

Less tedious config/cfg/ini/yaml configuration than just plaintext alone.

Only tested on retroarch's own .cfg where everything is a string at the moment.

Goal is to have this publicly hosted, as a PWA, and perhaps an electron port eventually that can edit files directly from device.
